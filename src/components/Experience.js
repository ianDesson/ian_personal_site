      My Resume can be found here or if you want a quick overview:

      Field Effect Software
      At Field Effect, I mostly did automated testing with Python.
      My main project was to create a virtual network and test the threat detection capabilities of Covalence.
      This meant simulating various network attacks and varifying their detection in the product.

      Cision Inc.
      At Cision, I was the only QA automation developer for our tool called ZEN.
      ZEN was a REST API for providing analysis on all the published news articles in the world!
      In my spare time, I also helped work on the REST API using Java.

      Nuance Communications
      At Nuance, I primarily worked as a Front-End Developer working on Nuance Mix!
      My regular tasks involved implementing changes to the UI of the Mix Dashboard and NLU tools.
      I also developed a new library of our React components and its CI/CD in GitLab!
      Another project I worked on was an app for streaming files to the Mix REST API.
