        <h2>💻 Technology 💻</h2>
        I initially learned to code in Java during High School and have enjoyed
        using code to solve problems ever since!

        Next, I learned Python through online courses the summer before
        university.
        <br />
        Lastly, I taught myself JavaScript to make better websites and then
        learned React to make bigger apps!
        <br />
        I have also learned other technologies like Git, PostgreSQL, SASS,
        Docker, and Express.

        <h2>🇬🇧 Languages 🇫🇷</h2>
        I consider myself bilingual in English and French!
        <br />
        I learned French from Grade 3 to 12 in Ontario's French immersion
        program.
        <br />
        During my studies, I took the DELF B2 test, which was the highest level
        of fluency for grade 12 students!
